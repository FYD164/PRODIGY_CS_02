# PRODIGY_CS_02
Second Task (CS)

This Python program provides functionality to encrypt and decrypt image files  . By using  encryption method, it modifies the pixel data in an image to generate an encrypted version, which cannot be understood without the proper decryption key. This key allows for decrypting the image, restoring it to its original state.


I completed the Second part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
